    Hey, I'm Trent Vendy, a Platform Engineer, Full Stack Developer, and Mental Health Advocate.
  </div>

  <div class="prose m-auto p-2">
    I like building stuff, whether it's software like games, apps, or APIs; to physical things like computers, cat towers, 3D printed gadgets and gizmos, and most recently even my own outdoor decking!
  </div>

  <div class="prose m-auto p-2">
    Something I like even more is people. I've recently discovered just how much I love helping, teaching, and trying to find ways to better myself and others. I love the challenge of figuring out how someone learns, and how I could pass on my knowledge in such a way that suits them.
