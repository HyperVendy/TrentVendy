    My professional life has taken me on some interesting and rewarding paths, each gave me something unique I could learn from, starting in Service Desk Support where I found my love for helping people. When I moved to Melbourne and joined a big company, I quickly learned that I love working with new fancy technology, the challenge of learning how to adopt a new stack, and have a knack for picking things up fast. Then came KPMG, my first look into the consulting world and a truly big company, well, kind of. This is where I met a man who would completely redefine what work meant to me, helped me find my direction, and what I was truly passionate about (and hey, he does coaching too, check out <a href="https://shariq.khwaja.au" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his site</a> if you're interested), while also completely ruining me in the process. Ok that might be somewhat cynical, but seriously, it's like a fancy person who gets used to fine dining, working with my mentor taught me what "good" looks like, and I can't un-know that. This started my rabbit hole journey into the world of "The Cloud".

    Since then I have been madly learning all the fun things that come along with the cloud, and while at KPMG I became one of only 10 people at the time within the organisation with the skills, knowledge, and ability to take something from an idea in someones noggin, to a fully productionised, KPMG suit approved, highly secure and scalable application.

    I am currently looking for the next opportunity, if you'd like to chat feel free to message me either on my email below, or LinkedIn.
